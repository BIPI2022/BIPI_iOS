# Overview
- The original author of this code will no longer be developing and coding this project and therefore will not be providing assistance or support. Please make your own choice whether to continue using the original framework or to redevelop using native. If you have any difficulties reading the code, please study the uni-app framework first and refer to the documentation links below.
- Please note that this is not native iOS development, it is written using the uni-app framework and Vue.js, if you don't know how to use this code, please refer to the links and documentation given below.
- This part of the iOS development code is still in its early stages, which means that if you want to switch to native Swift language and Xcode development, there is not much to lose, and it also means that this code will not be of any help if native development is considered.
